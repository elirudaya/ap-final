            <p class="di11">the terminal serves as the main control point 
                for the neurointerface. here, users can configure session 
                parameters, select memories for playback or analysis. 
                its minimalist design with touch panels ensures intuitive 
                interaction with the system.
            </p>
            <p class="di22">this is the core of the system, where all data
                received through the neurointerface is stored. the storage 
                uses advanced encryption and compression algorithms to 
                ensure the security and integrity of memories. visually, 
                it resembles a dynamic network of glowing threads, symbolizing 
                neural connections.
            </p>
            <p class="di33">a high-performance computing module that processes 
                data in real time. It converts neural impulses into digital 
                signals and vice versa, enabling seamless memory playback. 
                its design combines functionality and aesthetics, reflecting 
                the high-tech essence of the project.
            </p>
            <p class="di44">this element connects the capsules, allowing the 
                user's consciousness to move between different memory sections. 
                the tunnel is visualized as a luminous corridor with a motion 
                effect, creating a sense of traveling through time and space.
            </p>
            <p class="di55">the area where the user connects to the neurointerface. 
                the contact zone is equipped with sensors that read brain activity 
                and transmit it to the system. Its ergonomic design ensures comfort 
                and full immersion in the process.
            </p>
            <p class="di66">an interactive display that shows the system’s current
                status and visualizes memories. It can project both abstract imagery
                and specific scenes from the past, adapting to the user’s requests.
            </p>
            <p class="di77">allows users to navigate the memory space and control 
                playback. It includes voice commands, gestures, and the neurointerface 
                for the most natural interaction possible. The system’s interface is 
                intuitive and seamlessly integrated into the capsule’s overall design.
