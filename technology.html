            <p class="tc11">pure, undistracted experience. if other capsules
                are tools, this space is closer to a state of deep sleep or 
                meditation. complete isolation from the outside world, no 
                visual noise, not even tactile sensations—just the user’s 
                consciousness and a selected memory, amplified to incredible 
                intensity.<br>
                here, you can relive a first kiss, feeling every moment as 
                vividly as if it were happening for the first time. or practice 
                a complex violin piece until your fingers memorize every movement 
                at a muscle-memory level. Some users report that time flows 
                differently inside—minutes stretch into hours.<br> 
                but this depth comes at a cost: a 48-hour recovery period is 
                required after each session. The Local Immersion Capsule is the
                most powerful and demanding tool in the system, and it must be 
                handled with care.
            </p>
            <p class="tc22">This is a dynamic space where memories exist in their 
                most fragile and volatile state. The capsule operates with 
                high-speed neural buffers, allowing users to relive recent events, 
                fleeting impressions, and even thoughts that never fully formed into 
                clear images.<br>
                The atmosphere inside is one of constant motion: holograms of memories 
                flicker, overlap, and sometimes distort like reflections in rippling 
                water. This space is ideal for psychologists studying the mechanisms 
                of forgetting or investigators reconstructing events from fragmented 
                eyewitness accounts.<br>
                The system actively cools itself—a soft hum of ventilation serves as 
                a reminder that the brain, like any machine, needs breaks. Sessions 
                here are shorter than in other capsules but more intense: short-term 
                memory resists prolonged interference.
            </p>
            <p class="tc33">A vault of everything we call "the self." Unlike the 
                fleeting impressions of short-term memory, here, memories take shape, 
                accumulating details and emotions. But they are not static—over time, 
                some fragments fade into digital "noise," while others grow even more 
                vivid.<br>
                The capsule’s interior resembles an infinite archive, where key life 
                moments are highlighted like important documents, while peripheral ones 
                fade into the background. The walls react to the emotional tone of 
                memories: warm golden patterns for joyful moments, blue ripples for calm 
                ones, sharp red flashes for painful ones.<br> 
                Working with long-term memory requires caution—excessive interference 
                can "contaminate" the original memories. Before each session, the system 
                performs meticulous calibration, and the process itself feels more like 
                meditative immersion than rapid switching between events.
            </p>
            <p class="tc44">A laboratory for thought. This space is designed not so much 
                for revisiting the past as for engaging with the present—users can simulate 
                scenarios, solve complex problems, or even form "cognitive ensembles" for 
                collective thinking.<br>
                Inside, an atmosphere of creative chaos reigns: thought holograms take the 
                form of 3D diagrams, rapidly shifting schematics, or abstract shapes pulsing 
                in sync with neural activity. The system highlights zones of heightened 
                focus—areas where users direct their attention.<br>
                But there are limits: prolonged use leads to mental exhaustion, so the capsule 
                is equipped with biofeedback mechanisms. When the brain is overworked, users 
                feel gentle pulses—a reminder that even the most advanced interface requires rest.
